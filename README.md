# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of thsi analysis is to read visualize data from a ride hailing service. From this data we aim to correlate the relationships between revenue and local population denisty to make recommendations based on our findings.

## Results

#### Fig 1

We can see herein Fig 1 that the density of the city greatly affects the number of rides given by the ride service drivers. This is as expected as fewer people typically means fewer rides needed. We can also see that the average fare for each ride climbs greatly when in suburban or rural areas. This could be for a multitude of reasons. Rides given in urban areas are most likely shorter versus rural and therefore each fare will be smaller, which would also explain the much greater volume of rides given in more urban areas. Due to this we can see that drivers can earn more servicing rural areas whilst giving fewer rides.

Fig 2 illustrates the revenue generated by drivers over 5 month span in 2019. We can see that urban areas clearly generate the most revenue. This isn't surprising given the volume of rides given in those areas. Despite being less lucrative for drivers, more population density correlates to more money for the company.

While this analysis provides a good snapshot of the demographics of rides, a deeper dive could be achieved with some more data collected. Metrics like length of ride, time and surge pricing could be helpful in providing a greater understanding of the business model.

## Summary

With the analysis we performed, we can make the follwing recommendations:

- A pricing model varying based on the date may help maximize profit.
  - There are some clear low and high points throughout our 5 month data range.
- Recruiting drivers to rural areas with the proimse of higher earnings may increase the workforce in those demographics. 
- Increasing pricing in urban areas would serve to increase revenue and allow drivers to earn more, as those areas seem inelastic.
